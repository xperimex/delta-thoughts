__Hello, World__! Iâ€™m Adi Mittal, a student at [Terman Middle School](http://terman.pausd.org). I enjoy food, math, running, martial arts, and music of memes.

My main intent in starting this blog is to share my thoughts, ideas, and outlooks on cool math. My primary goal is to create content that's interesting and to share my thoughts on the world around me. I hope my ideas and thoughts can appeal to you, just as it did to me and showed me the interests of math!
