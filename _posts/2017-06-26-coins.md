__Coins!__ As some of you may relate to this, I love to take a coin, and just spin it on a flat surface or table. It's just satisfying, but being put to shame by the so called "Fidget Spinner". I was spinning a coin a few days ago, and was ultimately bored at the time, so I decided to ask myself a simple question: __What can information from the coin can be taken away from it spinning?__ This then was taken into is there a __correlation__, or ratio, between the __rate at which the coin rotates__, and the __rate at which it "wobbles"__. With a goal in mind, I picked up my pencil and started to work things out.
